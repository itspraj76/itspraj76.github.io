        <li>Eiffel Tower</li>
        <li>Louvre Museum</li>
        <li>Notre-Dame Cathedral</li>
        <li>Luxembourg Gardens</li>

        <ul>
            <h3 class="tourist-places"><li>Eiffel Tower</li></h3>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Tour_Eiffel_Wikimedia_Commons.jpg/400px-Tour_Eiffel_Wikimedia_Commons.jpg" alt="The beautiful Eiffel Tower of Paris during the day time." width="180">
        <p class="descriptions">The Eiffel Tower today stands as one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world. Visitors can walk up to the first floor of the Eiffel Tower or take the elevator all the way up to the top, where they'll be treated with vast birds-eye view of the elegent city. </p>
        
        <ul>
            <h3 class="tourist-places"><li>Louvre Museum</li></h3>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Louvre_Courtyard%2C_Looking_West.jpg/1609px-Louvre_Courtyard%2C_Looking_West.jpg" alt="The most widely known museum in the world, Lourve Museum with a glass pyramid right in the middle of the lake in front of the gorgeous building." width="535">
        <p class="descriptions">I think everyone agrees that if you hadn't been to a museum yet in Paris, its <em>got</em> to be the Louvre. This is because not only is the Louvre widely considered to be one of the best art museums in Europe, but one of the best in the world! It would be regretful if you hadn't even visited it <em>once</em>!</p>
        
        <ul>
            <h3 class="tourist-places"><li>Notre-Dame Cathedral</li></h3>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Cath%C3%A9drale_Notre-Dame_de_Paris%2C_3_June_2010.jpg/600px-Cath%C3%A9drale_Notre-Dame_de_Paris%2C_3_June_2010.jpg" alt="Most beautifully designed cathedral in the world, is located in Paris, France." width="411">
        <p class="descriptions">Just like the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral is like a Parisian icon. It is located near the River Seine and its relaxing, luxury feel restaurant cruises. Notre-Dame Cathedral is a Gothic design, and a <strong>breathtaking</strong> one at that. It is also known as one of the best Gothic architectural cathedral ever! </p>
        
        <ul>
            <h3 class="tourist-places"><li>Luxembourg Gardens</li></h3>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/LuxembourgMontparnasse.JPG/560px-LuxembourgMontparnasse.JPG" alt="A view of the castle and its garden from a bird-eye view." width="435">
        <p class="descriptions">This breathtakingly garden piece isn't just filled with <em>just</em> cute flowers but the history of it is quite interesting as well. Luxembourg Gardens, inspired by the Boboli Gardens in Florence, Italy, were created upon the initiative of Queen Marie de Medici in 1612. You might find interest of the first french museum to ever open to the public in the open field of lilies and all other types of flowers. </p>
        
        <ul>
            <h3 class="tourist-places"><li>Palais Garnier</li></h3>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Ceilings_of_the_palais_Garnier_in_Paris%2C_04.jpg/702px-Ceilings_of_the_palais_Garnier_in_Paris%2C_04.jpg" alt="The unbelieveible design of the elegent ceilings inside of the Palais Garnier opera house" width="469">
    <p class="descriptions"><strong>First time going to an opera house?</strong> Palais Garnier is the one. It was built for the Paris Opera from 1861 to 1875 at the request of Emperor Napoleon III. It was originally called "Salle des Capucines" because of its location on the Boulevard des Capucines in the 9th district of Paris. It was soon known as "Palais Garnier" in memory of his architect Charles Garnier.  Without Napoleon III, who was responsible for commissioning the opera, Leroux's tale would have never come to fruition. </p>
